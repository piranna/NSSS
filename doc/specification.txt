Differences with JSON-RPC 2.0
=============================

If a call doesn't return nothing, the 'result' field is not included in the
response instead being transmited a 'result: null' entry.

Responses have an 'ack' field instead of 'id' so a request can be included on
the response message, creating dialogs. A dialog is a succession of successful
call messages whose request is included on the result message of the previous
petition.
